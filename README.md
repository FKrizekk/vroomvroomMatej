# vroomvroomMatej
My 3D horror-ish game where a sentient car named Matej, chases you through a dessert and your main objective is to catch him. I'm developing it in Unity, i use some assets from the Unity Asset Store but other than that i work on it alone (my friend David provided psychological/mental help).
